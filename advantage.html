              <h2>1-Reduction In Human Error</h2>
              <p>One of the biggest advantages of AI is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision. The decisions taken by AI in every step is decided by information previously gathered and a certain set of algorithms. When programmed properly, these errors can be reduced to null</p>
              <h2>2-Zero Risks</h2>
              <p>Another big advantage of AI is that humans can overcome many risks by letting AI robots do them for us. Whether it be defusing a bomb, going to space, exploring the deepest parts of oceans, machines with metal bodies are resistant in nature and can survive unfriendly atmospheres. Moreover, they can provide accurate work with greater responsibility and not wear out easily.</p>
              <h2>3-Digital Assistance</h2>
              <p>Almost all the big organizations these days use digital assistants to interact with their customers which significantly minimizes the need for human resources. You can chat with a chatbot and ask them exactly what you need. Some chatbots have become so intelligent these days that you wouldnâ€™t be able to determine whether you are chatting with a chatbot or a human being</p>
              <h2>4-New Inventions</h2>
              <p>
                AI has helped in coming up with new inventions in almost every domain to solve complex problems. A recent invention has helped doctors to predict early stages of breast cancer in women using advanced AI-based technologies.</p>
              <h2>5-Unbiased Disicions</h2>
              <p>Human beings are driven by emotions, whether we like it or not. AI on the other hand, is devoid of emotions and highly practical and rational in its approach. A huge advantage of Artificial Intelligence is that it doesn't have any biased views, which ensures more accurate decision-making</p>
