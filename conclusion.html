            <p>Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing the industries with its applications and helping solve complex problems. Do you agree with our list of Artificial Intelligence Applications? Think we missed anything important? Or do you have any questions for us? Feel free to share them with us in the comments section of this article. We’d be thrilled to hear from you!</p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence and the technology are one side of the life that always interest and surprise us with the new ideas, topics, innovations, products …etc. AI is still not implemented as the films representing it(i.e. intelligent robots), however there are many important tries to reach the level and to compete in market, like sometimes the robots that they show in TV. Nevertheless, the hidden projects and the development in industrial companies. 

                At the end, we’ve been in this research through the AI definitions, brief history, applications of AI in public, applications of AI in military, ethics of AI, and the three rules of robotics. This is not the end of AI, there is more to come from it, who knows what the AI can do for us in the future, maybe it will be a whole society of robots.</p>
